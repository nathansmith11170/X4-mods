# X4-mods
My mods for X4 - these are development source and not intended for installation.

## Capital Ships Interdict

L and XL fighting ships halt travel drives of hostile ships in local space

Performance Impact: Mid - this is a fairly script-heavy clobber approach to accomplishing the feature

Intention:

Military fleets are now forced now engage each other instead of fast-traveling past.
Fighters no longer engage travel drive and ram into things during combat with large targets.

Secondary Effects:

It's much harder to get through hostile sectors now.
Trade and mining ships will absolutely get destroyed in greater numbers as they path into hostile interdiction range.

## Buy and Sell Stations

Player can buy and sell stations

## No Neutral Aggro

This prevents neutral ships from being triggered by player-owned weapons fire. It's a crude cheat that stops fleet engagements from turning your +30 ally into an enemy.
This also has implications for piracy and exploitation, so take it or leave it.
